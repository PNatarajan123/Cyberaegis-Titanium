security-level [value] - Assigns a security level to the SVI interface
no forward int vlan [vlan-number] - Disable forwarding to a vlan
ip address dhcp – Interface configuration mode command that requests an IP address from the upstream device
ip address dhcp setroute - Same command but it also requests and installs a default route to the upstream device
If the interface is connecting to an upstream DSL device providing point-to-point over Ethernet services, then it can discover its IP address by using the following:
ip address pppoe - Interface configuration mode command that requests an IP address from the upstream device.
ip address pppoe setroute - Same command but it also requests and installs a default route to the upstream device
switchport access vlan vlan-id - Changes the VLAN assignment of the port from the default of VLAN 1.
no shutdown - Enables the Layer 2 port.
route interface-name 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 next-hop-ip-address - default route
passwd password - Configures the Telnet/SSH password.
telnet <ip-address> <subnet-mask> <interface-name> - Identifies which inside host can telnet to the ASA.
telnet timeout minutes - Alters the default exec timeout of 5 minutes
username name password password - Creates a local database entry.
aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL - Configures SSH to refer to the local database for authentication. The LOCAL keyword is case sensitive and is a predefined server tag.

DHCP
dhcpd enable inside - Enables the DHCP server service (daemon) on the inside interface of the ASA.
dhcpd address [ start-of-pool ] - [ end-of-pool ] inside - Defines the pool of IP addresses and assigns the pool to inside users. Notice that the start-of-pool and end-of-pool IP addresses are separated by a hyphen

dhcpd dns dns-ip-address - Configures the DNS server IP address.
dhcpd wins wins-ip-address - Command to configure the WINS server address.
dhcpd lease seconds - Configures the lease time in seconds. The default is 3600 seconds (1 hour).
dhcpd option value - Configures the DHCP option code. Option code is in the range 0 – 250.
If the ASA outside interface was configured as a DHCP client, then the dhcpd auto_config outside global configuration mode command can be used to pass DNS, WINS, and domain information obtained from the DHCP client on the outside interface to the DHCP clients on the inside interface.
http server enable - Enables the ASA HTTP server. Note that this command uses port 443 by default for HTTP connections.
http ip-address subnet-mask interface-name - Specifies a host (or hosts) that can access the ASA HTTP server using ASDM.

To remove all the object groups from the configuration, use the clear configure object-group global configuration mode command.
ACLs for ASA
Differences between ASA and IOS: 
ASA acls use network mask(255.255.255.0) instead of wildcard mask(0.0.0.255)
ACLs are named instead of numbered
By default, interface security levels apply access control without an ACL configured
To allow connectivity between interfaces with the same security levels, use the same-security-traffic permit inter-interface global configuration mode command
To enable traffic to enter and exit the same interface, such as when encrypted traffic enters an interface and is then routed out the same interface unencrypted, use the same-security-traffic permit intra-interface global configuration mode command.
Types of ACLs
Extended - Specifies source and destination, protocol and ports
Standard - Specifies only destination(different from IOS!)
Ethertype - Only configured if security appliance is running in transparent mode
Webtype - Used in a configuration that supports filtering for clientless SSL VPN.
access-list id extended { deny | permit } protocol { source-addr source-mask } | any | host src-host interface src-if-name [ operator port [ port ]] { dest-addr dest-mask } | any | host dst-host | interface dst-if-name [ operator port [ port ]] - Configures ACL
access-group access-list { in | out } interface interface-name [ per-user-override | control-plane ] - Apply ACL
access-list id [ line line-num ] [ extended ] { deny | permit } object-group protocol-obj-grp-id object-group network-obj-grp-id object-group service-obj-grp-id ] object-group network-obj-grp-id object-group service-obj-grp-id ] [ log level ] [ interval secs ] [[ disable | default ] | [ time-range time-range-ID ]] | [ inactive ] - ACL with object-groups
NAT for ASA
Configure NAT with a network object
nat [ ( real-ifc , mapped-ifc ) ] dynamic { mapped-inline-host-ip [ interface ] | [ mapped-obj ] [ pat-pool mapped-obj [ round-robin ]] [ interface ]} [ dns ]
Dynamic NAT:
object network mapped-obj - Names the network object that identifies the pool of public addresses.
range ip-addr-1 ip-addr-n - Assigns IP addresses in a range.
object network nat-object-name - Names the NAT object.
subnet net-address net-mask - Assigns a network subnet to the named object. Alternatively the range command could be used.
nat ( real-ifc , mapped-ifc ) dynamic mapped-obj - Maps a static address to a mapped-inline-host-ip address.
Dynamic PAT:
object network nat-object-name - Names the PAT object.
subnet net-address net-mask - Assigns a network subnet to the named object. Alternatively the range command could also be used.
nat ( real-ifc , mapped-ifc ) dynamic interface - Provides inside hosts on the real-ifc to overload the outside address of the mapped-ifc interface.
Static NAT:
object network nat-object-name - Names the static NAT object.
host ip-addr -Identifies the host inside IP address.
nat ( real-ifc , mapped-ifc ) static mapped-inline-host-ip - Statically maps an inside address to an outside address.
        You could also use any instead of mapped-ifc to translate an object between multiple interfaces with just one cli command
AAA for ASA
username name password password [privilege priv-level] - Create local user accounts
Configure tacacs+ or radius server:
aaa-server server-tag protocol protocol - Creates a TACACS+ or RADIUS AAA server group.
